# llvm-jit-ptx

This demonstrates run-time fusion of a kernel that calles a device function. The device functions go in the [dfunc](dfunc/) crate, which is `no_std` and included both as a regular crate on the host (where it's easily tested) and compiled to LLVM-IR.

In one mode, `build.rs` compiles to PTX. In the second, the linking and compilation to PTX is done at run-time. Either way, the PTX is loaded and run using the CUDA device API.

## Notes

* [nvJitLink](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-12-0-compiler-support-for-runtime-lto-using-nvjitlink-library/) provides a way to link together artifacts from different sources into a fused kernel. It works with LTO-IR, which must match the major version of libnvJitLink. LTO-IR can be generated by NVCC and NVRTC, but not to my knowledge by upstream LLVM.
