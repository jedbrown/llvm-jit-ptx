## Notes

* [nvJitLink](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-12-0-compiler-support-for-runtime-lto-using-nvjitlink-library/) provides a way to link together artifacts from different sources into a fused kernel. It works with LTO-IR, which must match the major version of libnvJitLink. LTO-IR can be generated by NVCC and NVRTC, but not to my knowledge by upstream LLVM.
